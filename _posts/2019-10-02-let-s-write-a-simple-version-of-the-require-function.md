You should know that Javascript (better to say EcmaScript) does not specify any function to read and write files.

In fact, **Javascript is just the language used by many environments** (the browser, or NodeJS, are examples of environments) that offer more objects and functions to work with.

Node was the first environment to offer a way to organize code in modules by using a special function called `require()`. How does it work? Let's try to implement it from zero.

Here is an example of `require` at work:

```javascript
//test.js
module.exports = "Hello World";
```

```javascript
//main.js
const test = require("./test.js"); 
console.log(test) 
```

Let's write that `require` function.

## What should a require() function do

a `require` function is expected to:

* read the content of a javascript file in a string
* evaluate that code
* save the exported function/object in a cache for later use (only read files once)

### Disclaimer

We will not rebuild the whole NodeJS in a single post. In fact, I will not implement many NodeJS checks and giggles, we are only interested in understand how things work.

We will still need the real `require` function to load the `fs` module. I'm not cheating, it's just that this post has to end sooner or later :)

### myRequire() function

here's the code:

```javascript
//file setup.js

const fs = require('fs');

myRequire.cache = Object.create(null); //(1)

function myRequire(name) {   
    if (!(name in myRequire.cache)) {     
        let code = fs.readFileSync(name, 'utf8'); //(2)
        let module = {exports: {}}; //(3)
        myRequire.cache[name] = module; //(4)    
        let wrapper = Function("require, exports, module", code); //(5)
        wrapper(myRequire, module.exports, module); //(6)
    }
    return myRequire.cache[name].exports; //(7)
}

...
```

### Did you forget to declare myRequire variable?

No. In Javascript, functions declared with `function` keyword are evaluated before any other code (functions are "hoisted") so they can be referenced even before they're declared.

Also, functions can have properties (_this is javascript_!) so you can add the `cache` property to the `myRequire` function **(step 1)**.

Finally we're creating the `cache` property with `Object.create`. With this function we can specify the object prototype, we have chosen to not specify a prototype. Why? This way we don't mess with other functions or properties declared by the runtime. [Here's an explanation](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/5e62us/is_there_a_reason_to_create_an_object_without_a/).

***

Let's go back to `myRequire` . If the file we're importing is not in cache, we read the file from disk **(step 2)**.

Then we declare an empty `module` object with just one property, `exports` **(step 3)**.

We add this empty module to the cache, using the filename as the key, and then the magic happens **(step 4)**.

## The Function constructor

In JS we can evaluate a string js code in two ways. The first way is via `eval()` function, that is a bit dangerous (it messes up the scope) so it is highly discouraged to use it.

The second way to evaluate code that we have in a string is via the `Function` constructor. This constructor takes a string with the arguments and a string with the code. This way everything has its own scope and doesn't mess things up for others.

So, basically we are creating a new function with these variables **(step 5)**: `require`, `exports`, and `module`. Let's think for a moment at the first example of this post, the file `test.js`: it becomes

```javascript
function(require, exports, module) {
  module.exports = "Hello World" 
}
```

and the second file, `main.js`:

```javascript 
function(require, exports, module) {
  const test = require("./test.js"); 
  console.log(test) 
}
```

Variables that seemed "global" in files are indeed passed as function arguments.

## Last step: executing the function

We have created **(step 6)** a `wrapper` variable that holds a function, but the function is never executed. We do this at the line:

```javascript
wrapper(myRequire, module.exports, module); 
```

Note that the second variable (that should be `exports`) is just a handle to `module.exports`; NodeJS creators thought that this [could have helped in writing less code...](https://blog.tableflip.io/the-difference-between-module-exports-and-exports/)

When Node executes the function, everything that was "exported" (your public API) gets linked to the cache.

(Remember the `myRequire.cache[name] = module;` line? When it was first found by the compiler it was point to a dummy `{ exports: {} }` object; now it contains your module.)

> NOTE. Since we pass `myRequire` to the wrapper function, we can from now on use `require` in our test files, but our require gets called. Add a console.log if you don't trust me ;)

Finally... `myRequire` returns the `export`ed stuff you declared **(step 7)**, and that we saved to the cache so we won't have to reevaluate this code again.

## Final considerations

An example of this code [can be found here](https://github.com/musikele/require-example), along with some console logs that explain what's going on.

The idea of this article comes from the [explanation of this function at chapter 10 (Modules)](https://eloquentjavascript.net/10_modules.html#h_N33QHgUxbG). The book ([Eloquent Javascript](https://www.eloquentjavascript.net)) is excellent, but I had the urge to better understand, and try with a debugger, what I could not understand with my mind alone.

You should definitely read the book if you want to better understand javascript.
