I have successfully moved all my blog from Wordpress to Jekyll (what you see is the proof of it!) but there was one thing I was really missing: a web console to easily manage the blog when I don't have a computer on hand.

Than I found [Forestry.io](http://forestry.io){:style="font-weight: bold;"}, a cloud enviornment to manage your static site.

## <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">How is my blog set up </span>

My blog is hosted on github and I use some custom plugins that are not allowed by github default jekyll integration. That's why I use Travis-CI to build my website at every commit - if the build goes well, the build is pushed to github again (master branch) and served to you.

I explain my setup not because it's cool (it is _very_ cool) but because **forestry.io** covers my case too, so I guess that can cover every possibile case.

## How does Forestry.io works

Forestry.io is a cloud web application that gives you back what you miss more with Jekyll: a backend management for your website/blog.

You simply authorize Forestry to access your github account, tell forestry your blog repo (and branch), and voilà! You have a good backend for your Jekyll blog.

Here's a screenshot of my backend while I am writing this article in a wysiwyg editor: 

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Schermata%202017-01-02%20alle%2012.35.41.png)

You get a 

*   **wysiwyg editor** <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">for posts and pages that is completely in-sync with the repository</span>  

*   a **custom url** <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">to access the blog-management without going to forestry.io website everytime</span>  

*   <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">support for **parameters** in front matter (with auto recognition!) </span>
*   <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">support for **drafts** </span>
*   <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">**upload** of images and files</span>

In practice, they set-up a custom route (`/admin` ? you can choose it) with a `.js` file that connects with their servers and does all the magic for you. 

All of this for the price of **free** (for one user/blog). Isn't this just _fantastic_? 

You can still manage your blog from your preferred editor, offline, on your pc; Forestry will not get angry for this. 

I only have a **feature request**: a **native mobile app** (android please!). 

Kudos to them :)
