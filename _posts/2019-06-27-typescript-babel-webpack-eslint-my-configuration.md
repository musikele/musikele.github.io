The purpose of this post is to give you, dear reader, an example of the configuration I use on some projects. Configuring the whole stack is sometimes frustrating. Here's what works for me.

## Typescript

I [just wrote an article](https://michelenasti.com/2019/06/24/typescript-why-so-complicated.html) about that and you should read it. It contains my `tsconfig.json` and why every option is configured that way.

## Babel ( 7.x )

> **Update (2019-10-16)**: on my work projects I had to use Typescript for transpiling, I'll cover this in the next paragraph. You can skip Babel setup if you do not need this. 

The fun fact is, even if we use Typescript and our files end with `.ts`, to build the project we will _skip_ typescript. Let me be clearer. We will use **Babel**, that is a transpiler, and **Webpack**, that is a bundler. Webpack will bundle files that are transpiled by Babel.

But wait?! Babel transpiles what? The latest trend is that Babel will _strip out_ every Typescript interface, annotation or type inference and will just transform the file to a normal `.js` file. This output will then be given in input to Webpack.

Enough talking! Time to install babel and it's dependencies:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/cli @babel/preset-env @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties @babel/plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread @babel/preset-typescript
```

Here's my babel setup:

```javascript
//babel.config.js
  module.exports = api => {
      const isTest = api.env('test');

      const targets = {
          browsers: "> 0.25%, not dead"
      }

      if (isTest) {
          delete targets.browsers;
          targets.node = "current";
      }

      return {
          "presets": [
              [
                  "@babel/env",
                  {
                      "useBuiltIns": "entry",
                      "corejs": "3.0.0",
                      targets
                  }
              ],
              "@babel/typescript"
          ],
          "plugins": [
              "@babel/proposal-class-properties",
              "@babel/proposal-object-rest-spread"
          ]
      };
  };
```

Quick explanation:

* I use Jest and puppeteer to test my code, and Jest requires `targets.node` to be set to `current`. If you don't use Jest and Puppeteer, just remove the `isTest`check.
* Babel works with presets, each preset will transform some pieces of code depending on some rules.
* `@babel/env` is a quasi-default rule, it will transform our js code to something that is understandable by something that is parsable by what's defined in `targets`.
* `@babel/typescript` is the king here. It will _strip off_ all Typescript specific data (interfaces, types, etc.).
* the two plugins added are already in a very advanced standardization process, but they are added because typescript allows them.

### Is it working?

run this command:

```bash
npx babel src --out-dir build_ts --extensions ".ts,.tsx" --source-maps inline
```

Here we'll run babel on the directory `src`, the output will go in `build_ts`_._

It works? without hassles? Let's go to the next step:

## Alternative to Babel: Typescript compiler (UPDATE) 

When I wrote this article I was just fine with babel + typescript + webpack, unfortunately shit happens and in this case the shit's name is called Internet Explorer. 

Babel is notoriously good at adding polyfills for older browsers, however this process was not particularly suitable for my use case since I develop a library and I did not want to bloat my project with external dependencies, only to support IE. 

So, if you use Babel you can add polyfills and you can follow [this article](https://www.codementor.io/lawwantsin/babel-polyfills-transforms-presets-csbnjsok6) to do it. **I still think Babel is the best solution for webapps (not for libraries)**. Babel does also do a great job in converting ES6-only objects (like Promises) to ES5 with the right configuration.  With the right set of babel plugins and polyfills, you can convert whatever syntax from the past, the present and the future. 

Instead, **Typescript will deliver a smaller bundle but you must be sure to be using a syntax that will work with IE**. If you use Promises, or fetch for example, TS will not provide any polyfill for it and you must manually check that IE will not break. Not the best experience, but not an impossible job either.  

In our case, the "broken" error came from the use of `Symbol`, that is used in `for... of` iterations. Read more to see what to change if you want to support `tsc` instead of babel for transpiling code. 

## Webpack (4.x)

Installation:

```bash
$ npm i --save-dev webpack webpack-cli babel-loader
```

**For Typescript:** change `babel-loader` with `ts-loader`. 

Here's my configuration:

```javascript
//webpack.config.js

var path = require('path');
var webpack = require('webpack');

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index',
  mode: 'development',
  devtool: 'false',
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'build'),
    filename: 'dist.js',
  },
  resolve: {
    extensions: ['.ts', '.tsx', '.js', '.json'],
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        // Include ts, tsx, js, and jsx files.
        test: /\.(ts|js)x?$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        loader: 'babel-loader',
      },
    ],
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

The most important part is the `rules` part. Our rule is that every file will be tested, if it ends with `.ts` it will be passed to plugin `babel-loader` that will pass the file to `babel` before assembling it with babel.

**For Typescript**: change the `rules:  [ ...` section with 

```js
rules: [{
    // Include ts, tsx, js, and jsx files.
    test: /\.(ts|js)x?$/,
    exclude: /node_modules/,
    loader: 'ts-loader',
}],
```

> **Note**: This is the most basic webpack setup I could come up with. Reality is much more complicated than this and [you may need to set additional options/plugins](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/output/). Don't be afraid to check out webpack documentation, you'll learn interesting things

### Is it working?

```bash
$ npx webpack
```

It should create the file `build/dist.js`.

## ESLint

Installation:

```bash
npm i --save-dev eslint @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin
```

Configuration code:

```javascript
//.eslintrc.js
module.exports = {
    parser: '@typescript-eslint/parser',
    parserOptions: {
        ecmaVersion: 2018,
        sourceType: 'module',
    },
    plugins: ['@typescript-eslint'],
    'env': {
        'browser': true,
        'es6': true,
        'jest': trueparser: '@typescript-eslint/parser',
    parserOptions: {
        ecmaVersion: 2018,
        sourceType: 'module',
    },
    plugins: ['@typescript-eslint'],
    },
    'extends': [
        'eslint:recommended',
        'plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended',
    ],
    'rules': {
    //...
    }
};
```

* we tell ESLint to use the [typescript parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@typescript-eslint/parser) with some specific parser options.
* Then we add the plugin @typescript-eslint that will provide us with some useful rules for typescript...
* ...Like `@typescript-eslint/recommended`, that contains a few rules that are recommended by the community.

> **Note**: if you convert a legacy Javascript project to typescript, the `typescript-eslint/recommended` set of rules is ... _too much_. That's why I usually comment it out and try to fix problems day after day.

## JEST 

this article doesn't really cover Jest and Typescript, but I'll only add this quick snippet for those who may find it useful. To configure Jest with TS:

install `ts-jest`:  

```basj
$ npm i --save-dev ts-jest
```

 add these lines to `jest.config.js`: 

```js
module.exports = {
    ...,
    transform: {
        '^.+\\.tsx?$': 'ts-jest'
    },
}
```
